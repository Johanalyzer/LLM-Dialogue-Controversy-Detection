# Detecting Controversy in ChatGPT Dialogues

This project explores the evolution of controversial speech in ChatGPT conversations and the feasibility of using machine learning models to classify such conversations as controversial. We utilized the WildChat1M dataset and developed a heuristic controversy score based on linguistic, emotional, and moderation features. Through semi-supervised label propagation and classification models, we demonstrated that controversy detection is feasible, even with simple models. Our topic modeling further revealed how controversial topics have evolved over time, shifting from fictional and entertainment-focused content towards socio-political discussions.
